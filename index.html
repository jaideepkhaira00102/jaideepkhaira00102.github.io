                    Hello, I am an aspiring developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions and exploring new technologies. 
                    I’m eager to offer my skills and make a meaningful impact while continuing to learn and grow in the field.<br><br> I hold
                    a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Ryerson/Toronto Metropolitan University, and I have hands-on experience in 
                    various domains including Web Development, Computer Graphics, Game Development, Artificial Intelligence, and 
                    Machine Learning. For me, every project is an opportunity to expand my knowledge, tackle new challenges, and 
                    deliver exceptional results.<br><br>I thrive in a team-based environment and excel at adapting under pressure. My greatest 
                    strength is my pragmatic approach and ability to stay calm and focused in stressful situations. While I continuously
                     strive to improve, I recognize that my journey is just beginning, and I’m committed to both personal and professional 
                     development. <br><br>I would love to connect with you! Whether you’re interested in collaborating on a project or just want
                      to have a chat, please feel free to reach out. You can explore my portfolio to see some of my work, and connect 
                      with me on LinkedIn. <br><br>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to work together and
                       discuss how we can create something extraordinary!
                </p>
