            So, to start, Part A took more time, it also took more patience and effort. However, it also gave me more freedom. While I had to work extra hard to get even the simplest of 
            features, once I did learn them, they were especially easy to implement. However, there were many problems. As a whole, I had to write a lot of code, which made it harder to
             navigate the next day. This may not seem like a big issue for my website, however, when scaled into real-world applications, it could cause a lot of problems. So, on the 
             whole It took more effort and provided more freedom to fine-tune but cost more time and effort and sacrificed readability.Part b on the other hand was quite the opposite, it took very little time to learn. However, that was partly because Part A already cleared the basics, while Part B built upon 
            it. However overall part b still took less time. It was also easier to get started and easy to scale with lesser code. However, it is to be noted that Bootstrap is a collection
             of codes of CSS. As such it is ultimately less efficient whereas pure CSS code should theoretically run faster. Itâ€™s the same argument of why some people prefer Python over c,
              even though Python is just a collection of c libraries with low efficiency but very easy to learn and implement while losing a great amount of freedom and efficiency. 
              (also one thing I did not expect was smooth scrolling on bootstrap, It looks so much better) <br><br>

              The main challenge in part 1 was having to write seperate(given we were not allowed to use java script) style classes for seperate designs, and in the end i had way too many classes
              . on the other hand, for Bootstrap, i was too restricted to fully express myself, even though it was easier to implement. It took me around 3 days on part a and 1 day on part b
              so around 3 to 1 ratio, although 1 of the days for part 1 was for general design, so more like2 to 1 ratio.
            
              Even with all this, I would still prefer a framework (in this case bootstrap) over pure CSS coding, as it is way easier to use and has very little downside, also if you feel 
              a lack of freedom, you can always overwrite the CSS code and make use of your own.
