        Today I will be using Tailwind as the framework.<br>
        To use it simply include https://cdn.tailwindcss.com as a src in script<br><br>
        <img src="firstcode.png" width = 100% height = auto><br>
        or you can visit the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn">Tailwind Website from this link</a>
    </section>
    <section class="text-sky-200 grid justify-center item-center">
        To start of I wrote some basic code like this and tested if tailwind was working by using text-sky-200<br><br>
        <img src="first code.PNG" width = 100% height = auto><br>
        Next I started working on the contents of the page mostly text explaining each step/planning for it<br>
        <a href="https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs">Then I visited the Tailwind Documents Website</a> to learn and apply styling to my page<br>
        you can also install Tailwind CSS using these simple steps:<br><br><br>

        and started applying styling to my webpage<br>
        The main difficulties encountered were really just choosing the framework and website to host my webpage<br>
        which was solved by github, being an already trusted site by me and <br>
        for picking the framework, I trusted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship">fireship(a youtube channel)</a>
        specifically these two videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr15Xzb1Ook">tailwind in 100 seconds </a> and 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHZwlzOUOZ4&t=1s">tailwind CSS is the worst.. </a>
        followed by a little bit more research online.<br>
        Tailwind itself was quite similar to Bootstrap as such i encountered very little problems<br>
        However the only big problem i encountered in tailwind itself was Choosing the color itself,<br>
        which was solved by spending some time in the documentation and some experimentation<br><br>
        As for styling i wanted to keep it simple so i used grid system, aligned everthing including<br>
        text in the middle and picked a blue themed background and text color given tailwind logo is blue<br>
        I used colouns in the installation part with 3 on first row and 2 on second to make it look better <br>
        and not put everthing in the middle. i also added some margins.<br><br><br>
        Thank you for visiting my website, I hope you have a lovely day ahead!!<br><br><br><br><br>
